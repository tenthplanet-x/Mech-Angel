# Tenth Planet
Tenth Planet is a virtual production house building games designed to revolutionize the GameFi industry. Taking a play-for-fun first approach to game development, our games have been designed with the core objective of making the player experience as seamless as possible, whilst still retaining all the fundamental benefits that blockchain gaming has to offer. 

Here at Tenth Planet we believe innovations such as player owned digital assets, integrated secondary markets and decentralized governance/community participation, will play a pivotal role in the disruption of the current gaming industry as we know it, paving the way for the next generation of games.

To build and realize these objectives, we have assembled a stellar team of both world class game developers and crypto experts alike, with proven track records in their respective fields.
